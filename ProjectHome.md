This plugin is based on joomap-fireboard-integration with a small modification in SQL query to check the permision. joomap-fireboard-integration will show all category, post of fireboard, event the category and post non-public (only for staff). With this modification, it only shows the public category, hence it show only the public post.

I just copy the description of joomap-fireboard-integration:

Joomap is the best site-map component for Joomla. Fireboard is going to be the best forum component for Joomla.

But, till now, there was no way to include forum contents, that is main/parent thread information, within Joomap's tree structure. Here is the plug-in to include Fireboard Forum contents in your Joomap and Joomap-Google map.
